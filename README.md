# positional-args - Node.js positional argument parser

This library is a positional argument parser for Node.js. The API is flexible
enough to parse just single arguments, or define an entire set of positional
commands. Commands can be parsed from strings or arrays, allowing this library
to be used both for command-line arguments and things like Discord bots.

## Installation

Available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/positional-args).

```
npm install positional-args
```

## Usage
Coming soon!
